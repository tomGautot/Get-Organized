# Get-Organized
Get Organized Android App

My first public Android App project.

Simple app that allows to organize things in a weekly, cyclic way.

The days are divided into "tasks".
Each task has a bunch of properties such as time (hour:minute), a type (Work, Social, Wake Up, ...), a list of days for which they are planned, ... 

As it is one of my first project, feedback is highly appreciated :D
